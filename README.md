# Introduction
1. Our game was intended to be an SVG Role playing game
2.We chose this as our project because we wanted to make a tribute to our 4 years in the APP academy in a humorous way.
# Method
We developed our project throughout the second semester of Senior year. Our website for the game was coded using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The game was coded in SVG. HTML is mandatory for websites. CSS was also required since it helps you design the website. We used Bootstrap because it made our buttons look better and overall complimented CSS very well. Challenges: SVG was a new library we did not cover in APP
We used online resources and the RAMP UPS to help us learn SVG. Our wiki: https://github.com/AdrianCeballos/Capstone-Project/wiki
The link to our wiki will take you to documentation we wrote as our project developed.
# Final Project
Our final project is a 2 page website and a basic SVG game. The first page is an ABOUT ME page in which we introduce the game. The second page is the actual game page. A screenshot of our actual SVG is here: https://gyazo.com/9de61a4ae80b9cb2767c387b7ee9abef 
The game has lateral movement, background and items that we tried to set as triggers but havent been successful yet.
# Future Work
As Adrian pursues his Computer Science degree I hope he will check back on this project and continue improving it. This project symbolizies a huge part in our High School years and should be updated to reach its full potential. As for myself, I hope to also find time to help improve it. Our SVG game does need improvements(triggers, different levels, characters) which will be improved in the future. We would also like to add more animations and characters. Not having a deep understanding of SVG made making this game very difficult. Like I stated before, this project will not be kicked to te curb because it symbolizes a huge part in my (and my partner's) high school years.
