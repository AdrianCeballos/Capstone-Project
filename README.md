# Introduction
1. Our game was intended to be an SVG Role playing game
2.We chose this as our project because we wanted to make a tribute to our 4 years in the APP academy in a humorous way.
# Method
We developed our project throughout the second semester of Senior year. Our website for the game was coded using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The game was coded in SVG. HTML is mandatory for websites. CSS was also required since it helps you design the website. We used Bootstrap because it made our buttons look better and overall complimented CSS very well. Challenges: SVG was a new library we did not cover in APP
We used online resources and the RAMP UPS to help us learn SVG.
